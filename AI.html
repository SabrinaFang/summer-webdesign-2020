            <p>
              In the 1950s, the fathers of the field Minsky and McCarthy,
              described artificial intelligence as any task performed by a
              program or a machine that, if a human carried out the same
              activity, we would say the human had to apply intelligence to
              accomplish the task. That obviously is a fairly broad definition,
              which is why you will sometimes see arguments over whether
              something is truly AI or not. AI systems will typically
              demonstrate at least some of the following behaviours associated
              with human intelligence: planning, learning, reasoning, problem
              solving, knowledge representation, perception, and, to a lesser
              extent, social intelligence and creativity.

            <p>
              AI works by combining large amounts of data with fast, iterative
              processing and intelligent algorithms, allowing the software to
              learn automatically from patterns or features in the data. AI is a
              broad field of study that includes many theories, methods and
              technologies, as well as the following major subfields:<br />

              <li>Machine learning</li>
              <li>Deep learning</li>
              <li>Neural network</li>
              <li>Cognitive computing</li>
              <li>Computer vision</li>
              <li>Natural language processing</li>
            </ul>

          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              The principle limitation of AI is that it learns from the data.
              There is no other way in which knowledge can be incorporated. That
              means any inaccuracies in the data will be reflected in the
              results. And any additional layers of prediction or analysis have
              to be added separately. Todayâ€™s AI systems are trained to do a
              clearly defined task. The system that plays poker cannot play
              solitaire or chess. The system that detects fraud cannot drive a
              car or give you legal advice. In fact, an AI system that detects
              health care fraud cannot accurately detect tax fraud or warranty
              claims fraud. In other words, these systems are very, very
              specialized. They are focused on a single task and are far from
              behaving like humans.Likewise, self-learning systems are not
              autonomous systems. The imagined AI technologies that you see in
              movies and TV are still science fiction. But computers that can
              probe complex data to learn and perfect specific tasks are
              becoming quite common.

              While these advances have been exciting for those of us in the
              industry, there remains a disconnect between our enthusiasm and
              the impact society at large is experiencing as a result of AI. In
              the next few decades, the technology industry will continue to
              make substantial advances in how AI can be applied, but the
              greater impact will come not from future nascent applications but
              by the widespread adoption of AI by other industries today we
              interact with on a daily basis. No industry will be safe from this
              change, but here are some of the industries that will change most
              significantly with the adoption of AI.
