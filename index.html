<br> Oprah didn’t find success by playing it safe. For example, in 1988 she had a group of Neo-Nazis on her show. The decision was obviously controversial and Winfrey regretted it, and said so. However, it put her and her show in the national spotlight. <br>
    <br> Winfrey was called "arguably the world's most powerful woman" by CNN and Time.com, "arguably the most influential woman in the world" by The American Spectator, "one of the 100 people who most influenced the 20th Century" and "one of the most influential people" from 2004 to 2011 by TIME. Winfrey is the only person in the world to have appeared in the latter list on ten occasions.[136]

At the end of the 20th century, Life listed Winfrey as both the most influential woman and the most influential black person of her generation, and in a cover story profile the magazine called her "America's most powerful woman". In 2007, USA Today ranked Winfrey as the most influential woman and most influential black person of the previous quarter-century.
