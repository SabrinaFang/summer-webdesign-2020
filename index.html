          A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous vehicle, connected and autonomous vehicle, driverless car, robo-car, or robotic car, is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input. The leading innovators in the field of driverless cars include Waymo by Google, GM Cruise by General Motors, and Tesla.

          <br>Artificial Intelligence is a way of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think intelligently, in the similar manner the intelligent humans think. AI is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks, and how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis of developing intelligent software and systems.

          <h2>Maglev Bullet Trains </h2>

            <br> <br> Unlike conventional trains that use wheels, the Maglev train is based on magnetic levitation, hence the name "Maglev". Electromagnets levitate the train just a little above the tracks. These magnets also create the thrust that moves the train. Compared to conventional trains, Maglev has superior controls as its acceleration and braking doesn't depend on friction of the track.
