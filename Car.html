              A Self Driving Car allows a car to drive without human input. The
              idea behind the self driving car is really simple: Outfit a car
              with cameras that can track all the objects around it and have the
              car react if itâ€™s about to steer into one.

              Since the 2010s, self driving cars have been envisioned by many
              companies. However, the task of creating a self driving car has
              turned out a lot harder that it was said to be. The self driving
              car's technology relies heavily on artificial intelligence that
              allows the car to sense things around it. The AI development for
              self driving cars has not been very succesful.

              Companies in the self driving car industry include Mercedes-Benz,
              General Motors, Continental Automotive Systems, Autoliv Inc.,
              Bosch, Nissan, Toyota, Audi, Volvo, Vislab from University of
              Parma, Oxford University and Google.

              Some people claim that self driving cars will be more
              environmentally friendly. This is because they believe AI will
              improved to learn to use fuel more efficiently. People claim that
              humans brake harshly, accelerate hard, and idle the engine. AI
              could fix this make driving better. There are also some drawbacks,
              people have been questioning the safety of self driving cars and
              people have been killed as well. Let's hope in the future, self
              driving cars will become more safe.
